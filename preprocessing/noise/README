These scripts generate both missing labels from normal data and noisy datasets from missing labels.

Here a lot is hardcoded unfortunately.

Put these scripts in a folder with the datasets that AMLSim output, and define the names of the datasets at the top of each scripts.

Ratios of missing label and noise are hardcoded so they need to be changed manually if something else than 10% and 25% is needed.

generate_missing_labels.py generates a dataset with missing labels for both the normal and SAR class.

generate_FP_FN.py generates a dataset with false positives and false negatives.

generate_topology.py NEEDS the list of alert members that is in the tmp folder in AMLSim. It generates a dataset with noist on specific topologies.

generat_neighbour.py generates a dataset with noise on the normal accounts connected to money-laundering accounts.
